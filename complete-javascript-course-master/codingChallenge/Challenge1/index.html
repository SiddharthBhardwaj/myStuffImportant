            Mark and John are ltrying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using formula: <br />
            BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). <br />
            (mass in KG and height in meter).<br />
            <br / >
            1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables <br />
            2. calculate both their BMIs <br />
            3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. <br />
            4. Print a String to the Console containing the variable from step3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). <br />
