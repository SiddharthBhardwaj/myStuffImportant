        <p>
            Johm and Mike both Play basketball in different teams. <br />
            In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, <br />
            while mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points. <br />
            <br />
            1. Calculate the average score for each team. <br />
            2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console.<br />
            3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take in account there might be a draw (the same average score) <br />
            <br />
            4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and er team scored 97, 134 and 105 pounts. Like before, log the average winner to the console. <br />
            HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.<br />
            5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws. <br />
            <br />
            GOOD LUCK :D
