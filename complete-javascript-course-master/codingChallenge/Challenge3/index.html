        <h3>Coding Challenge 3</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restraunts.<br />
            The bills were $124, $48 and $268. <br />
            <br />
            To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).<br />
            He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.<br />
            <br />
            In the end, John would like ti have 2 arrays:<br />
            1) Containing all the three tips (one for each bill).<br />
            2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).<br />
            <br />
            (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100 = 0.2 )<br />
            <br />
            GOOD LUCK :D
