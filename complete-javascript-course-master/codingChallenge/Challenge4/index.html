        1. Foer each of John's and Mark's BMI, create and object with properties for their full name, mass, and height. <br />
        2. Then, add a method to each oject to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.<br />
        3. In the end, log the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.<br />
