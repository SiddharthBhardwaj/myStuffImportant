        <p>
            John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. the bill were $124, $48, @268, @180 and $42.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when th bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implement a tip calculator using objeccts and loops:<br />
            1. Create an object with an array for the bill values.<br />
            2. Add a method to calculate the tip.<br />
            3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations<br />
            4. As an output, create <br />
                a. a new array containing all tips, and <br />
                b. an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).<br />
            HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            EXTRA AFTER FINISHING:Mark's family also went on a holdiay, going to 4 different restraunts. The bolls were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less then $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25$ if the bill is more than $300.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules.<br />
            6. Creat a function (not a method) to calculate the average of the given array of tips.<br />
            7. Calculate the average tip of each family.<br />
            8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips in average.<br />
            <br />
            GOOD LUCK :D
