            Suppose that you are working in a small town administration, and oyu're in charge of two town elements:
            1. Parks
            2. Streets 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
            <br />
            1. Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/ park area)
            2. Average age pof each town's park (formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)
            3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
            4. Total and average length of the town's streets.
            5. Size classification of all streets:
            tine/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal
        </p>
        <br />
        <P>
            All the report data should be printed to the console.
        </P>
        <br />
        <p>
            HINT: Use some of the ES6 geatures: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parametes, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.
